## Scripts for Installing ROCm on Ubuntu

This directory contains directions and scripts for installing ROCm on various versions of Ubuntu.
Each folder has scripts for installing ROCm on a particular version of Ubuntu; these scripts can be used to install from AMD's binary files or to build, install ROCm from AMD's source distributions, and build binary packages.

At this time, these tools have been tested on:

- [Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS](Ubuntu_16.04)
- [Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS](Ubuntu_18.04)
- [Ubuntu 18.10](Ubuntu_18.10)

The folder `common` contains scripts that are common between multiple Ubuntu versions, and can be safely ignored if you want to directly run the installation or build scripts.
