## Scripts for Installing ROCm on Fedora

This directory contains directions and scripts for installing ROCm on various versions of Fedora.
Each folder has scripts for installing ROCm on a particular version of Fedora; these scripts can be used to install from AMD's binary files or to build, install ROCm from AMD's source distributions, and build binary packages.

At this time, these tools have been tested on:

- [Fedora 28](Fedora_28)
- [Fedora 29](Fedora_29)

The folder `common` contains scripts that are common between multiple Fedora versions, and can be safely ignored if you want to directly run the installation or build scripts.
