## Scripts for Installing ROCm on CentOS

This directory contains directions and scripts for installing ROCm on various versions of CentOS. Each folder has scripts for installing ROCm on a particular version of CentOS; these scripts can be used to install from AMD's binary files or to build and install ROCm from AMD's source distributions.

At this time, these tools have been tested on:

- CentOS 7.4
- CentOS 7.5

The folder `common` contains scripts that are common between multiple CentOS versions, and can be safely ignored if you want to directly run the installation or build scripts.
