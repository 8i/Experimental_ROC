## Scripts for Installing ROCm on CentOS

This directory contains directions and scripts for installing ROCm on various versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Each folder has scripts for installing ROCm on a particular version of RHEL; these scripts can be used to install from AMD's binary files or to build and install ROCm from AMD's source distributions.

At this time, these tools have been tested on:

- [RHEL 7.4](RHEL_7.4)
- [RHEL 7.5](RHEL_7.5)

The folder `common` contains scripts that are common between multiple RHEL versions, and can be safely ignored if you want to directly run the installation or build scripts.
